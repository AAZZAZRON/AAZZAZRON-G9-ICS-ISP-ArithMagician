# ArithMagician (ICS2O ISP)

This was my grade 9 ICS ISP. It's a program that teaches the user how to do basic arithmatic as well as order of operations. I had a really fun time making this program, although I spent a lot of time diffrentiating processing arrays from python lists :/

Anyway, have fun!
